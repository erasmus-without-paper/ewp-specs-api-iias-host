IIA Get endpoint
================

* [What is the status of this document?][statuses]
* [See the index of all other EWP Specifications][develhub]


Summary
-------

This endpoint allows the client to get the contents of IIAs stored on the IIA
Host.


Request method
--------------

 * Requests MUST be made with either HTTP GET or HTTP POST method. Servers MUST
   support both these methods. Servers SHOULD reject all other request methods.

 * Clients are advised to use POST when passing large number of parameters
   (servers MAY set a limit on their GET query string length).


Request parameters
------------------

Parameters MUST be provided either in a query string (for GET requests), or in
the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format (for POST requests).


### `iia_id` (repeatable, required)

A list of IIA identifiers (max 500 items) - IDs of agreements the client wants
to retrieve information on.

This parameter is *repeatable*, so the request MAY contain multiple occurrences
of it. The server is REQUIRED to process all of them.


Permissions
-----------

All requests from the EWP Network MUST be allowed access to this API. Consult
the [Echo API][echo] specs for details on handling unprivileged requests.


Handling of invalid parameters
------------------------------

 * General [error handling rules][error-handling] apply.

 * Invalid (unknown) `iia_id` values MUST be ignored. Servers MUST return
   a valid (HTTP 200) XML response in such cases, but the response will simply
   not contain the information on the unknown `iia_id` values. (If all values
   are unknown, servers MUST respond with an empty envelope.)

 * If the length of `iia_id` list is greater than 500, servers MAY respond
   with HTTP 400. Clients SHOULD split such large requests into a couple of
   smaller ones.


Response
--------

Servers MUST respond with a valid XML document described by the
[get-response.xsd](get-response.xsd) schema. See the schema annotations for
further information.
